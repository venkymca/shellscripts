# echo command 

The echo command in shell scripting is commonly used to display text or variables to the user.

Syntax:

   echo [-neE] "arguments"

   -n (No newline): 
      
       . By default, echo adds a newline at the end, but -n stops that.

   -e (Enable escape sequences):
   
       . This option enables the interpretation of escape sequences (such as \n for a new line, \t for a tab, etc.)
       . If you don’t use -e, escape sequences will be treated as normal characters and won’t perform their special function.
       
   
   -E (Disable escape sequences):

      . his option explicitly disables the interpretation of escape sequences. 
      . Even if escape sequences are included in the argument, they are treated as regular text.
