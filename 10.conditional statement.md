**Conditional Statements**

* conditional statements are used to perform actions based on certain conditions.
* The most common conditional statements are:

     if
     if-else
     if-elif-else

**Simple if statement:**

The if statement allows you to execute a block of code if a condition is true.

  #!/bin/bash
  number=20
  
  if [ $number -gt 5 ]; then
  
  echo "The number is greater than 5."
  
  fi

**if-else statement:**

The if-else statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true, and another block if the condition is false.



#!/bin/bash
number=10

if [ $number -gt 100 ]; then

  echo "The number is greater than 100."
  
else

  echo "The number is not greater than 100."
  
fi



**if-elif-else statement**

The if-elif-else statement is used when you need to test multiple conditions.

#!/bin/bash

number=7

if [ $number -gt 10 ]; then

  echo "The number is greater than 10."
  
elif [ $number -eq 7 ]; then

  echo "The number is equal to 7."
  
else

  echo "The number is less than or equal to 10, but not 7."
  
fi


**case statement**

The case statement is used when you need to match multiple possible values for a variable.

#!/bin/bash

fruit="apple"

case $fruit in
  "apple")
    echo "The fruit is apple."
    ;;
  "banana")
    echo "The fruit is banana."
    ;;
  "orange")
    echo "The fruit is orange."
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Unknown fruit."
    ;;
esac
