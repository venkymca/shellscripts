**Loops:**

* loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true or for a specific number of iterations.
* The main types of loops in shell scripting are:
 
   for
   while
   until


**for Loop**

* The for loop is used to iterate over a range of values or items in a list.
* It is commonly used when you know in advance how many times you want to loop.


  

#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..5}
do

  echo "Iteration number $i"
  
done

**for loop with a list of values:**


#!/bin/bash

fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry" "date")

for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"
do
  echo "I like $fruit"
  
done


**for loop with an index**


#!/bin/bash

for ((i=1; i<=5; i++))
do
  echo "The value of i is $i"
done

**while Loop**

* The while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
* It's useful when you don't know the number of iterations in advance, but you know the loop should stop based on a condition.

#!/bin/bash

count=1

while [ $count -le 5 ]
do
  echo "Count is $count"
  ((count++))
done


**until Loop**

* The until loop is the opposite of the while loop.
*  It executes as long as the specified condition is false, and stops once the condition becomes true.


#!/bin/bash

count=1

until [ $count -gt 5 ]
do
  echo "Count is $count"
  ((count++))
done
